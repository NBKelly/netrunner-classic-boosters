What's the aim here?

The aim is to be able to generate sets of "booster packs" for ONR in a repeatable (deterministic)
  way for N players, for online draft/play.

There are three sets:
  Base Set v1.0
  Proteus v2.1
  Classic v2.2 (this is a smaller set)

How were the cards distributed?
  * classic was never officially released, so those just have to be purely random

Starter:
  Base Set.
  60 cards each side
  11 vital, 30 common, 17 uncommon, 2 rare (each side)
Starter Booster:
  2 vital, 7 common, 5 uncommon, 1 rare (random mix of corp and runner)
Proteus Booster:
  10 common, 4 uncommon, 1 rare (random mix of sides)
Classic Booster:
  6 common, 2 rare (random mix of sides)


Additionally, I'm excluding cards I wasn't able to implement - so there's an excludelist.
